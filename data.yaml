  - Thanks you very much, Mr Blankfein. We've heard in earlier panels today example
    after example where Goldman was selling securities to people and then not telling
    them that they we taking and intended to maintain a short position against those
    same securities. I'm deeply troubled by that. And it's made worse when your own
    employees believe that those securities are junk or piece of crap or shitty deal.
    Billion dollar timber wolf, synthetic CDO squared. CDOs get squared now. Senior
    executive called it a shitty transaction, but the Goldman sales force was told
    it was a priority item for two straight months. Goldman sold $600 million in timber
    wolf securities to clients while at the same time holding a short position. In
    other words, betting against it. CDO goes to -- with the junk status in about  seven
    months. Your investors lost big time. But Goldman won on that deal. Profited on
    that deal. In the $500 million Long Beach RMBS deal, Goldman shorted it the same
    time it was selling it to clients. Securities defaulted within a few years with
    a 65% delinquency rate. The bad news, in your own words, was that your clients
    lose money, but the good news is that Goldman Sachs made money on that deal. The
    next one, $700 million Fremon deal. Notoriously bad lender. Your folks knew it.
    One of your clients talks to your sales force about it, and your sales force,
    among themselves, call it crap loans. They go out and sell them anyway. At the
    same time that you're selling -- your people -- your salespeople are selling those
    items, they are shorting the deal. So you short them so that Goldman makes money
    when this security fails, which it did in ten months. On the $300 million Anderson
    synthetic CDO, CDO is stuffed with new century loans. These are known to be shoddy
    loans. I think it was or two in the list of bad loan producers. A client of yours
    asked, how did Goldman Sachs get comfortable with this deal? Goldman Sachs, in
    other words, pointing out that it was New Century. Goldman Sachs didn't respond
    and did not say, we're not comfortable. We're shorting it. We're betting against
    this deal. Asked a direct question with a deal involving those loans? And instead
    of responding honestly, we got problems too, we're not taking chances on this
    deal, we may be selling it, but we're also betting against it, that's not what
    happened. Instead, the client was told  that Goldman was an equity holder which
    it was at the same time. But that was half the truth.  Because it was also betting
    against that same security. That CDO failed within seven months. Your client lost.
    Goldman profits. The $2 billion Hudson synthetic C DRK O. Goldman Sachs was the
    sole protection buyer on this CDO with a $2 billion short. In other words, they
    were  betting against it. Goldman salesperson described it as junk. Not to the
    buyer, of course. But inside. The CDO imploded within two years. Your client lost.
    Goldman profited. Now there's such a fundamental conflict, it seems to me, when
    Goldman is selling securities which particularly when its own people believe they
    are bad items described in the way these emails show that they were described
    and how they were -- but what your own salespeople believed about them, to go
    out and sell these securities to people and then bet against those same securities,
    it seems to me , is a fundamental conflict of interest, and it raises a real ethical
    issue. And I'd like to ask whether or not you  believe that Goldman, in fact,
    treated those clients properly and, as you say, if clients believe we don't deserve
    their trust, your not going to  survive . Those are the ringing words you give
    us in your opening statement. Given that kind of history here, going heavily short
    in the market, which you did, you made a strategic decision to do that, but then
    on these specific  examples, to be betting against the very securities which you're
    selling to your clients and internally your own people believe that these are
    crappy securities, how do you expect to deserve the trust of your clients and
    is there not an inherent conflict here?

  - 'Not necessarily. '
- :label:
    :speaker: LC
    :time: 
  :lines:
  - Not necessarily. But they have at least the right to believe that you want that
    security to work for them. That's a belief which I would think most customers
    would have. But here's what you -- in these -- examples after examples, it's not
    just that you sold something, which obviously meant that someone was buying it.
    There a seller and a buyer. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking
    about betting against the very thing that you're selling. Betting against it.
    Going short against is without disclosing that to that client. Do you think people
    would buy securities from you if you said, you know, we want you to know this.
    We're going to sell you this. But we're going to a -- going out and buying insurance
    against this security succeeding. We're take the short position. We're getting
    thing out of our inventory. We're betting against this very thing we're selling
    to you. That's a totally different thing from selling a security and no longer
    having an interest in it. My question is, is there not a conflict when you sell
    something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security
    and you don't disclose that to the person you're selling it to? Do you see a problem?

    in a conflict of interest situation.

    a short position against the very security. I read you over and over and over
    again. You're selling securities. Many of which are described as crap by your
    own sales force internally. Putting that aside for just a moment. We'll come back
    to that. That makes it worse. But there's an inherent conflict when you don't
    disclose to your client that this security that you're buying from us has obviously
    a short side. But we're the people who are keeping the short on this one. We're
    betting against this one. And you don't think that's relevant to a client?

    housing market went south very quickly after some of these securities, not all

  - But Goldman's doing pretty well? And one of the reason's obviously, why Goldman's
    doing pretty well, before they got the $10 billion or T.A.R.P. money, of taxpayers'
    money, there was a November 2007 e-mail from you that stated, quote, of course
    we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. we lost money then we made more than we lost
    shorts. That's a quote from your e-mail that you wrote. How much did you make,
    more that you lost, because of shorts?

  - 'We did not make -- we did not make big money. '
  - What I was referring to in my e-mail was that -- and this was on the back of a
    message that was looking at part of our business, and saying they made a lot of
    money on shorts, when I knew that we had a lot of longs and a lot of shorts that
    netted to very very small position as our goal during this period was just to

  - You know, Mr. Blankfein, there's a lot of animosity out there, I'm sure you have
    seen that, and we find, in my state for example, there's 48% of the homes are
    still under water, in other words, they're worth less, as you know, than the payments
    that are being made. And the community banks continue to struggle and have great
    difficulties. You received $10 billion in T.A.R.P. money and the community banks
    are the ones that are going under. Maybe you could -- do you think that that in
    the minds of a lot of Americans, that's there a real contradiction there. You're
    doing fine, you're paid perhaps you earn them, I'm not qualified to say that.
    Meanwhile , community bank, the ones who are the direct lenders in the housing
    market, the direct involvement the ones that -- not you, but that the homeowners
    relied on, are the ones that are struggling and still having enormous difficulty,
    including my home state of Arizona. Do you see? Do you understand why people might
    think there's a dichotomy there, Mr. Blankfein, even unfairness even there? I
    understand that life isn't fair, but a lot of Americans don't quite understand
    what went on there, don't understand what hit them.

  - 'They are not necessarily -- again, not knowing in general -- not speaking generally
    or specifically, maybe some helped to author their own situation by overlending
    or making imprudent judgments, but I''m sure for many, they just conducted their
    social purpose and lent out money against housing. '
  - The people who owe them the money can't pay it back and the housing they have
    as collateral goes down in value. They may very well be victim of the recession,
    and that's -- I can understand -- and I share your concern for the situation.

  - 'The reason why one would want to pool mortgages is it gives diversification,
    so you can pool mortgages, not from just one community but distribute it over
    the whole country. '
  - 'The reason one would want to slice it, is  so you can pick your place on the
    credit spectrum and say, I''d like the more senior mortgages, I''d like the more
    junior risks. '

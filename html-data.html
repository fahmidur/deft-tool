		<p>Thanks you very much, Mr Blankfein. We’ve heard in earlier panels today example after example where Goldman was selling securities to people and then not telling them that they we taking and intended to maintain a short position against those same securities. I’m deeply troubled by that. And it’s made worse when your own employees believe that those securities are junk or piece of crap or shitty deal. Billion dollar timber wolf, synthetic CDO squared. CDOs get squared now. Senior executive called it a shitty transaction, but the Goldman sales force was told it was a priority item for two straight months. Goldman sold $600 million in timber wolf securities to clients while at the same time holding a short position. In other words, betting against it. CDO goes to -- with the junk status in about  seven months. Your investors lost big time. But Goldman won on that deal. Profited on that deal. In the $500 million Long Beach RMBS deal, Goldman shorted it the same time it was selling it to clients. Securities defaulted within a few years with a 65% delinquency rate. The bad news, in your own words, was that your clients lose money, but the good news is that Goldman Sachs made money on that deal. The next one, $700 million Fremon deal. Notoriously bad lender. Your folks knew it. One of your clients talks to your sales force about it, and your sales force, among themselves, call it crap loans. They go out and sell them anyway. At the same time that you’re selling -- your people -- your salespeople are selling those items, they are shorting the deal. So you short them so that Goldman makes money when this security fails, which it did in ten months. On the $300 million Anderson synthetic CDO, CDO is stuffed with new century loans. These are known to be shoddy loans. I think it was or two in the list of bad loan producers. A client of yours asked, how did Goldman Sachs get comfortable with this deal? Goldman Sachs, in other words, pointing out that it was New Century. Goldman Sachs didn’t respond and did not say, we’re not comfortable. We’re shorting it. We’re betting against this deal. Asked a direct question with a deal involving those loans? And instead of responding honestly, we got problems too, we’re not taking chances on this deal, we may be selling it, but we’re also betting against it, that’s not what happened. Instead, the client was told  that Goldman was an equity holder which it was at the same time. But that was half the truth.  Because it was also betting against that same security. That CDO failed within seven months. Your client lost. Goldman profits. The $2 billion Hudson synthetic C DRK O. Goldman Sachs was the sole protection buyer on this CDO with a $2 billion short. In other words, they were  betting against it. Goldman salesperson described it as junk. Not to the buyer, of course. But inside. The CDO imploded within two years. Your client lost. Goldman profited. Now there’s such a fundamental conflict, it seems to me, when Goldman is selling securities which particularly when its own people believe they are bad items described in the way these emails show that they were described and how they were -- but what your own salespeople believed about them, to go out and sell these securities to people and then bet against those same securities, it seems to me , is a fundamental conflict of interest, and it raises a real ethical issue. And I’d like to ask whether or not you  believe that Goldman, in fact, treated those clients properly and, as you say, if clients believe we don’t deserve their trust, your not going to  survive . Those are the ringing words you give us in your opening statement. Given that kind of history here, going heavily short in the market, which you did, you made a strategic decision to do that, but then on these specific  examples, to be betting against the very securities which you’re selling to your clients and internally your own people believe that these are crappy securities, how do you expect to deserve the trust of your clients and is there not an inherent conflict here?</p>

		<p>Not necessarily. But they have at least the right to believe that you want that security to work for them. That’s a belief which I would think most customers would have. But here’s what you -- in these -- examples after examples, it’s not just that you sold something, which obviously meant that someone was buying it. There a seller and a buyer. That’s not what we’re talking about. We’re talking about betting against the very thing that you’re selling. Betting against it. Going short against is without disclosing that to that client. Do you think people would buy securities from you if you said, you know, we want you to know this. We’re going to sell you this. But we’re going to a -- going out and buying insurance against this security succeeding. We’re take the short position. We’re getting thing out of our inventory. We’re betting against this very thing we’re selling to you. That’s a totally different thing from selling a security and no longer having an interest in it. My question is, is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security and you don’t disclose that to the person you’re selling it to? Do you see a problem?</p>

		<p>Yeah. You’re betting. You’re going short against the security. You’re holding a short position against the very security. I read you over and over and over again. You’re selling securities.

Meanwhile , community bank, the ones who are the direct lenders in the housing market, the direct involvement the ones that -- not you, but that the homeowners relied on, are the ones that are struggling and still having enormous difficulty, including my home state of Arizona. Do you see? Do you understand why people might think there’s a dichotomy there, Mr. Blankfein, even unfairness even there? I understand that life isn’t fair, but a lot of Americans don’t quite understand what went on there, don’t understand what hit them.</p>

		<p>Absolutely. I think community banks play a very, very important role. </p>
		<p>They are not necessarily -- again, not knowing in general -- not speaking generally or specifically, maybe some helped to author their own situation by overlending or making imprudent judgments, but I’m sure for many, they just conducted their social purpose and lent out money against housing. </p>
		<p>The people who owe them the money can’t pay it back and the housing they have as collateral goes down in value. They may very well be victim of the recession, and that’s -- I can understand -- and I share your concern for the situation.</p>

		<p>I was going to build to it. </p>
		<p>A CDO is a pool of assets. </p>
		<p>In this case mortgage assets, mortgage that are pooled together and then can be sliced in a way that will yield a particular credit exposure. </p>
		<p>The reason why one would want to pool mortgages is it gives diversification, so you can pool mortgages, not from just one community but distribute it over the whole country. </p>
		<p>The reason one would want to slice it, is  so you can pick your place on the credit spectrum and say, I’d like the more senior mortgages, I’d like the more junior risks. </p>
		<p>In a synthetic, you don’t pool the actual mortgages, per se, you pool reference securities that are indexed to specific pools of mortgages.</p>

		<p>Yes, you’re doing it in a way to get specific risk in a specific place, at a specific spectra, level of the spectrum, without necessarily having to assemble the particular securities, and so you can do it more quickly and you can do it more precisely.</p>
